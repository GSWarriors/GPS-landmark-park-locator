# GPS-landmark-park-locator
In-the-process app that tracks landmarks and parks located nearby.

I created this app because I know that when people are on vacation or have free time, they want to find where to want to go as fast as
possible in order to not waste this time. Google maps tells you things like where the nearest restaurants, gas stations, and hotels are, 
but it doesn't necessarily target specific things like parks and landmarks within a set radius with the press of a button. I created this 
app to make it easier to do just that.
